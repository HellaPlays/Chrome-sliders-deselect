Download the 7z and add it as a extention in your chrome browser

The Zip includes the 4 files that you also find here, if you feel safer downloading the induvidual files
Then just put them all into a folder and add them to the browser
The Background.js is NOT needed, but included... Literaly does nothing, just there from when I was making this extention
